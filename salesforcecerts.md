**About Me**

Jay Janarthanan  
[https://www.linkedin.com/in/jayonsoftware/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jayonsoftware/)  
[jay@jayonsoftware.com](mailto:jay@jayonsoftware.com)

* 30 years as a Software developer
* Almost 9 years in Salesforce, expertise in large codebase SF projects. 
* In the past 12 months, I have looked at over 1000 Salesforce resumes, interviewed over 200 people, and hired a few
* I have zero SF certification \(I had a few and let it expire\)
* Co-organizer of Detroit Salesforce and Mulesoft user groups. 

**The economic argument to why I am taking time off from work to study**

Each cert will take 80 to 160 hours of studying if you study properly \(See below on the proper way of studying\) and I can't do that when I am working 60 hour weeks. 

If I pass all the SF certs, I set out to complete them. I will make the money I lost by not working. Already have job offers with a signing bonus that will pay back the investment and more.

**Why am I teaching SF**?

Starting soon, I will be spending 16 hours a week teaching SF \(Admin, Dev, Vlocity\) to a corporate client. I wanted to do this \(other than it pays well\) because it forces me to learn. I have to prepare the curriculum, create demos, answer student's questions, etc. All this forces me to spend more time studying. 

‌When I was employed, I had a bose to yell at me, but now I do not have that, and I know I lack the discipline to study \(Every day I yell at my kid, but no one is yelling at me\). Thus this teaching gig is a godsend. 

**Why Salesforce Certifications**

This may be my worst suggestion considering the environmental impact, but if you are the type of person who likes to print out documents and read them, look at [Epson EcoTank ET-4760](https://epson.com/For-Work/Printers/Inkjet/EcoTank-ET-4760-All-in-One-Cartridge-Free-Supertank-Printer—White/p/C11CG1920). While most color printers cost about 10 cents per page to print, this cost less than a cent.
