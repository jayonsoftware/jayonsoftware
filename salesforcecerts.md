* 30 years as a Software developer
* Almost 9 years in Salesforce
* in the past 12 months, I have looked at over 1000 Salesforce resumes, interviewed over 200, and hired a few
* I have zero SF certification \(I had a few and let it expire\)
* Currently Unemployed \(But I am not looking for a Job\)

**The economic argument to why I am taking time off from work to study**

  
Almost 9 years in SF and zero certification  
Can’t work 10 to 12 hours a day and Study  
Each cert will take 80 to 160 hours of studying

If I pass the above SF certs, I will make the investment back in 8 months

**Why Salesforce Certifications**
